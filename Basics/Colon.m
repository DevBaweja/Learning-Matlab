1:-1
%  1X0 empty double row vector

-10:2:-1
% generate numbers from -10 to -1

10:-2:1
% generate number from 10 to 1 with -2 as adder
%%
a:b
% a<=b as it always add +1 to reach b
a:s:b
% if a<=b then s>0
% if a>=b then s<0
% also s cannot be zero

% it is unnecessary that we must have a or b in the end result
%% For a
% if a is absent then follwing conditions are unfollowed
% if any of condition are followed we will have a in result
%% For b
% b does not affect much it may or may not present in the result
% only possible if spacing is aligned perfectly
