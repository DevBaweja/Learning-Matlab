% Char of varies size
% string is created
% '' froms char and "" for string
% also we can use similar as constructor
 a = ["hi","how";"are","you"]; % simply creating strint array
 b = "hi how are you";
 
 c = string('hello world');
 % use "hello world" instead of string('hello world')
 
 d = string(["hi";"how";"are";"you"])
 
 % similarly logical is use 
 
 tbool = logical(0)
 fbool = logical(1)
  
 % n > 0 is true and n < 0 is false
 tbool = true
 fbool = false
